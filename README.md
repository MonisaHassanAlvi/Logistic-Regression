- ## Visualizing the Data
Before starting to implement any algorithm, it is always good to visualize the data if possible. Write a code to display a figure like Figure 1, where the axes are the two exam scores, and the positive and negative examples are shown with different markers.

Implement the sigmoid function. Your code should also work with Matrices and vectors. For a matrix, your function should perform the sigmoid function on every element.
